My first programming experience was in an EE C++ data structure course in 2009.
Since then, I taught myself more on programming, involved open source
communities, became an IT in lab, and had done many personal projects
(documented on my [blog](http://www.idryman.org))
as well as academic projects. 
Now I found myself best suited in iOS programming and am looking to find a job
in this area.

## iOS projects
* [Pendulum+](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/pendulum+/id558261535?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo\%3D2)
  A chaotic double pendulum physics simulation with great use of Core Animation.
  It has good peroformance, low battery usage, and runs smoothly on all iOS
  platforms.
  Technical details for Core Animation is on
  [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/u/dryman/p/mastering-core-animation)

* [Earthquake early warning prototype](http://www.idryman.org/blog/2012/09/15/earthquake-early-warning-prototype/)
  ARM to iOS push notification.

* [Taiwan typhoon app](http://www.idryman.org/blog/2012/09/16/taiwan-typhoon-app-1/)
  Grab typhoon prediction from Taiwan central weather bureau.

* [Handle Touch events in UIWebView](http://www.idryman.org/blog/2012/06/18/handle-touch-events-in-uiwebview/)
  UIWebView masked its event handling method. In this project I hijacked single
  touch event and let UIWebView handle other touch events (pin, scroll, double
  touches...etc.)

* [GCD vs OpenMP benchmark](http://www.idryman.org/blog/2012/08/05/grand-central-dispatch-vs-openmp/)
  Grand Central Dispatch is a great parallel programming model introduced by
  Apple. I implemented a GCD version of Conjugate Gradient algorithm from
  [NAS Parallel Benchmark](http://www.nas.nasa.gov/publications/npb.html)
  and compare to OpenMP version offered by NASA. The GCD results are great.

## Other projects
* [File::Monitor::Lite](http://search.cpan.org/~dryman/File-Monitor-Lite-0.652002/lib/File/Monitor/Lite.pm)
  Perl module for monitoring file creation, modification, and deletion.

* [Lingua::MMSEG](http://search.cpan.org/~dryman/Lingua-ZH-MMSEG-0.4005/lib/Lingua/ZH/MMSEG.pm)
  Perl module of Chinese word segmentation.

* [Macho.js](https://github.com/dryman/Macho.js)
  Chinese text wrapping. (Forked and is used in Taiwan web designer's community)

* [CangJieX](https://github.com/dryman/CangJieX)
  CangJie Chinese input method for OSX.

* [Octopress graphviz plugin (Ruby)](http://www.idryman.org/blog/2012/04/04/jekyll-graphviz-plugin/)
  Add new syntax into octopress, so that you can write graphviz direct in
  octopress markdown section.
