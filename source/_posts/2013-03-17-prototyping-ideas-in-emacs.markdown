Rapid prototyping has became very popular these days; there are so many frameworks, mock up softwares, lorum-ipsum generators, html templates, mobile devices templates, or  white board that are used as a prototyping strategy. However, most prototyping tools targets on visual appearance instead of the actual work flow in the program. Even though Ruby on Rails or other web frameworks make you easily construct a working site, the database is not easy to alter, and it still take time to create user interfaces. What I want to seek is a tool that focuses on flexible data structure and program work flow; in addition, a basic user interface is a plus. 

Today I'm going to show you the power of Emacs and [org-mode][org-mode] that works as a complete model-view-controller prototyping beast.
