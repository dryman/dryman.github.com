This year I switched from vim to emacs. The reason is quite simple, I want to try different things, that's all. Emacs is a highly configurable editor that you can use it to read emails, chat on irc, read pdf files, or whatever you can imagine. One of the most useful plugin is using `emacs-w3m` to browse websites.

### Install

Emacs-w3m is an old package, luckily the latest package still functions well :D

This installation guide is mac specific, but you can replace the first command to other platform-specific package installer. I use Mac OSX 10.8, and the latest homebrew until May 15, 2013. In your shell, type in the following:

```bash
brew install w3m
mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/vendor
cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.namazu.org:/storage/cvsroot login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.namazu.org:/storage/cvsroot co emacs-w3m

cd emacs-w3m
autoconf
make
```

Then, in your `.emacs`,

```scm
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/vendor/emacs-w3m/")
(require 'w3m-load)
```

That's all you need. :)

### Other settings

If you want to open url links in w3m from org files, you can use the following setting, reference to [emacs wiki post](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BrowseUrl#toc26).

```scm
(defadvice org-open-at-point (around org-open-at-point-choose-browser activate)
  (let ((browse-url-browser-function
         (cond ((equal (ad-get-arg 0) '(4))
                'browse-url-generic)
               ((equal (ad-get-arg 0) '(16))
                'choose-browser)
               (t
                (lambda (url &optional new)
                  (w3m-browse-url url t)))
               )))
    ad-do-it))
```
